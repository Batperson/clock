There is a high-frequency whine from the audio signal. This changes in frequency with the length of the
audio sample buffer, so there is likely a glitch when populating the buffer.

There is an audible glitch every 1 seconds, it is caused by the RTC interrupt.

Currently using 150 ohm / 0.1 uF RC low pass filter. HF PWM is attenuated to around 0.1V.
