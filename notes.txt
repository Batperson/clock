There is a high-frequency whine from the audio. This changes in frequency with the length of the
audio sample buffer, so there is likely a glitch when populating the buffer.

There is an audible glitch every 1 seconds, it is caused by the RTC interrupt.

Currently using 150 ohm / 0.1 uF RC low pass filter. HF PWM is attenuated to around 0.1V.

Implemented button firmware. IDR value is always 1 for all buttons.

Buttons are working correctly now. Needed to add pull-down resistors even though I specified internal pulldown resistors.

Implemented a beep routine for button press. This is working but a hard fault occurs if the beep is triggered
by a long button press while a song is playing.

160 * 128 bare TFT with 14-pin flex connector. Maybe glue directly to outside of enclosure?
Pinout:
1  NC
2  VSS		connect to GND
3  LED-		connect to GND
4  LED+		connect to 3V3 (LED backlight. Resistor needed?)
5  VSS		connect to GND
6  /RESET	reset active low
7  A0		data/command for 4-wire SPI
8  SDA		serial data, MOSI
9  SCK		serial clock
10 VDDA		connect to 3V3 (analog supply)
11 VDDIC	connect to 3V3 (VDDIO? digital supply)
12 /CS		chip select active low
13 VSS		connect to GND
14 NC

Clock set functionality working. Counter does not update immediately.
Next tasks:
* Implement a menu timeout to play an alarm song if the menu option is selected for 1 sec
* Implement a centre-align text render

Audio output has an unpleasant whine. The whine is reduced if LoadSoundBuffer returns early, and goes away entirely if the sound buffer
contains only zeroes. It shows on the oscilloscope as a square wave.
The whine is present on the VCC line so most likely digital noise.
The click which occurs every second when the screen refreshes is also present asa voltage drop on VCC.
The whine is most likely caused by voltage fluctuations which occur as interrupts change the demand for current.
It is mitigated by removing the __WFI() line (i.e. disabling sleep until interrupt) and by placing a 220uF cap
across VCC / GND.

Now possible to preview an alarm ring by highlighting it in the alarm menu, it will play after 1.5 secs.
